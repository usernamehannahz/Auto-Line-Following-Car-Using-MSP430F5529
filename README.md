# Auto-Line-Following-Car-Using-MSP430F5529

This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous line-following car built around the MSP430F5529 microcontroller. The car uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect a black line on a white surface, a dual H-bridge motor driver to control two DC motors for driving, and a servo motor for steering. The system employs Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) for both motor and servo control.
